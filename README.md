PyCharm Debugging Demo for Rookout

These are the code versions and .txt file relevant to the demo found at rookout.com/blog/getting-started-pycharm-debugging-python-apps 

The debuggingwiki.txt is a file containing the text of the Debugging article on Wikipedia. 

The four code files are in the order of:
  1. The simplest code
  2. The 2nd file is the first attempt to add a new feature (which generates an error in the debugger).
  3. The 3rd file is the second attempt to upgrade the code - it works, but isn't organized in descending order (and is marked error2 in the file name).
  4. The 4th and final file is the upgraded code that we want.
